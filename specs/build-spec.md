# Connect CELTA — build spec

Written 7 Aug 2026 by the designer, for Claude Code. Repo: `ramysakr1-ux/celta-connect` @ `main`.

This is the companion to the HTML designs in the sibling project. **The designs are references, not production code** — recreate them in the Next.js/Tailwind/Supabase app using its existing patterns. Everything below is a decision made with Ramy during design and is not recoverable from the screens alone.

Read `specs/apply-to-app.md` first for the token mapping and the chat-pill / timetable specs. This document covers everything after that.

---

## 0. Rules that constrain the whole system

These came from Cambridge's syllabus, the CELTA 5 booklet, the centre's own assignment briefs, and Ramy's corrections. Encode them once, centrally, and read them everywhere — not as scattered `if` statements.

**Course shape**
- 120 contact hours; 6 hours of assessed teaching per candidate; 8 TPs is the usual shape.
- A candidate must teach at a range of levels.
- Entry forms are submitted to Cambridge **two weeks before the course starts**. Record `courses.entry_form_sent_at`. This date is a gate — see §4.
- Attendance requirement is a **centre setting** (this centre: 100%, camera-off on Zoom counts as absent). Do not hardcode 80% or 100% anywhere.

**Teaching practice**
- A TP group splits into **halves of three teaching on alternate days**. Not everyone teaches every day.
- Rotation is **derived**, not stored per round: base order + round index, wrapping within the half. Change the base order and every future round recalculates.
- A withdrawn candidate **leaves an empty slot**. Positions of the others do not change. Do not re-derive.
- Observation is **not transferable**. A tutor may not mark a lesson they did not watch. If a tutor leaves, the replacement observes the next lesson themselves.

**Written assignments**
- Four assignments; **a candidate must pass 3 of 4 to be eligible for a PASS**.
- **One resubmission per assignment.** Fail on resubmission is a distinct outcome from Fail.
- Passing on first or second submission **does not affect the certificate grade**.
- Each assignment has **its own criteria list**, in its own order, imported from the centre's own cover sheet. Criteria are data. Never hardcode them.
- Assignments may be **conflated** — two briefs delivered as one document, counting as two, both parts must pass independently. The data model must allow one submission to satisfy two assignment records.
- Marked as **Met / Not met per criterion, per round** — not content/English pass marks. (An earlier design had this wrong.)
- Cover sheet carries: date, 1st marker, 2nd marker; four outcome boxes (Pass, Resubmission Needed, Pass on Resubmission, Fail on Resubmission); overall comment per round; the seven-point declaration including the AI conversation link.

**Grades**
- Provisional grades are trainer-only and never visible to a candidate before release.
- Final grades are **subject to confirmation by Cambridge**. The app is never the authority.
- Withdrawn and Extension are real outcome values alongside Pass A / Pass B / Pass / Fail.

**Chat**
- Resets at local midnight, every channel, no exceptions. Never a record of assessment.
- Trainees never get a cohort-wide channel — only their TP group and DMs to their own tutors. Staff channels are trainer-only, no admin exception (migration 0039).

## 1. Build order

Nothing below depends on anything above it being perfect, but this order avoids rework.

1. **Shell** — one 56px header replacing the current three bars. Wordmark left, nav, view-switcher, name. (`App Redesign.dc.html` 1a)
2. **Chat pill** — replaces `StaffChatDrawer` chrome; see `specs/apply-to-app.md` §1. Add the trainee/volunteer channel rules from §6 below.
3. **Timetable finish** — `specs/apply-to-app.md` §2. Everything downstream reads from it.
4. **Command Centre / Today** — replaces the marketing hero on `/trainer`. (`App Redesign.dc.html` 1a)
5. **Roster + portfolio** (1b, 1d)
6. **Rotation board** (`Rotation.dc.html`) — halves of three, derived order.
7. **TP points library and assignment** (`TP Points.dc.html`) — four release styles: scripted, framework, coaching prose, minimal.
8. **TP record** (`TP Record.dc.html`) — plan, procedure, self-evaluation, feedback in one screen with the form sticky right.
9. **Lesson plan** (`Lesson Plan.dc.html`) — narrow-left/wide-right; procedure table with fixed columns; timing sum against lesson length.
10. **Forms** (`Forms.dc.html`) — TP feedback, self-evaluation.
11. **Assignments** (`Assignment Review.dc.html`) — marking, resubmission side-by-side, four cover sheets.
12. **CELTA 5** (`CELTA 5 Record.dc.html`) — candidate and tutor columns, two counters.
13. **Grades report** (`Grades Report.dc.html`) — cohort sheet + per candidate; criteria lists generated from the CELTA 5 matrix.
14. **Assessor pack** (`Assessor Visit.dc.html`) — read-only token link. **Add the attendance register** (not yet designed; assessors ask for it and it may go to Cambridge).
15. **Trainee home** (`Trainee Home.dc.html`) — next session, announcements, waiting on you.
16. **Volunteers** (`Volunteer View.dc.html`, `Volunteer Register.dc.html`)
17. **Enrolment forms** (`Enrolment Forms.dc.html`) — candidate agreement, AI disclaimer, special consideration, complaints route.
18. **Pre-course task** (`Pre-Course Task.dc.html`) — five sections, aggregate view for the tutor.
19. **Centre admin** (`Centre Admin.dc.html`) — profile, Drive, brief import, tutors.
20. **Close-out** (`Course Close-out.dc.html`) — export, erase, duplicate.
21. **Demo** (`Demo Links.dc.html`) — flagged clone of the real app.
22. **Mobile** (`Mobile.dc.html`) — per-role scope, see §7.

## 2. Centre setup and the Drive model

**Import is a conversion, not a storage mode.** A centre connects Drive once and points at its brief and cover-sheet documents. The app parses them into template records: criteria rows, comment slots, section prompts, word limits. After import the source documents are finished — never served to a candidate, never round-tripped. Only the centre's *wording* survives, as data.

Consequence: no `.docx` is ever uploaded by a candidate or downloaded by a tutor as part of the assessment loop. Everything between import and export is app-native.

**Export is the mirror.** At close-out, one action writes the whole course to Drive as PDFs: folder per candidate (cover sheets, assignments, TP records with plans and feedback, self-evaluations, observations, CELTA 5, final report, certificate), plus course-level documents (grades report, timetable as taught, attendance register, tutor list). That export **is** the retention copy Cambridge requires, and it lives on the centre's Drive, not in the app.

**Sync is one-way, app → Drive, on release.** Never two-way. A file edited in Drive after marking would diverge silently from the record that generated it.

**Then the course closes.** Candidate accounts, submissions, feedback, chat and tokens are removed from the app; links stop working. The shell duplicates into the next course: resource hub, TP points library, assignment templates and criteria, timetable skeleton, time bands, tutor list, centre documents. Everything the centre built, none of the people.

**Blocking rules on close-out** — do not allow it while:
- a deferred candidate has no destination course chosen (or an explicit "hold at centre" flag);
- an extension is outstanding;
- Cambridge has not confirmed final grades. Hold the erasure, not the export.

## 3. Leaving the course — three statuses, not one

This is the area most likely to be built wrong. Three distinct things:

**Withdrawal** — formal and final. Requires a signed letter (the app generates it; see `Enrolment Forms.dc.html`). No reversal. A withdrawn candidate may still attend sessions unobserved and unassessed, so **withdrawn is a status, not a deletion**.
- Withdraw **before** `entry_form_sent_at`: Cambridge never sees them. Internal event only.
- Withdraw **after**: they appear in provisional and final grades with outcome **Withdrawn**.
- Their portfolio is **paused, not erased** — read-only, and it stays in the assessor pack marked Withdrawn, because assessors do ask to see withdrawn files.
- TP: the slot empties; nobody else moves.

**Deferral** — allowed **only if the candidate has completed more than half the course**. Otherwise it is a withdrawal.
- Freeze at the point they stop: portfolio locked, out of rotation and marking queue, link opens read-only.
- They are absent from the grades report and present in the roster as Deferred.
- At close-out the record **transfers** to the destination course rather than being erased, and also exports to Drive.
- The deferred candidate is added to the **new** course's entry form marked as deferred. **The assessor is informed.**
- What carries: completed TPs read-only and credited, with numbering continuing (TP4 next); passed assignments with their original marker; an open resubmission keeps its one remaining chance, deadline from the new timetable; CELTA 5 criteria stay met, each recording who assessed them and on which course.
- What does not carry: chat, links, workspace URL.
- **Open question for Ramy:** do carried TPs count toward the six assessed hours on the new course? This decides the new rotation.

**Extension** — for special consideration (illness, dyslexia, declared at enrolment). The candidate completes **after the official end date** and the final grade is recorded as **extension**. Close-out waits.

**Staff changes.** A tutor is deactivated, never deleted. Everything they wrote or signed keeps their name permanently — including if they die. Going forward, one name replaces another: the successor takes the group, the marking queue and the channels from that point. They may not mark an observation they did not watch.

## 4. `entry_form_sent_at` — why it matters

One field, four behaviours:

1. Decides whether a withdrawal is internal or a reportable **Withdrawn** outcome.
2. Fixes candidate **names** — the certificate prints the name on the entry form. After sending, warn on any name edit; it now diverges from what Cambridge holds.
3. Fixes the **cohort**. Adding a candidate after entry must be explicit and warned, or you get a full portfolio with no Cambridge entry, discovered at grading.
4. It is the one date on the course clock that does **not** derive from the timetable — it comes from Cambridge's calendar.

---

## 5. Guidance, not tours

Three kinds only. No product tour, no coach marks, no persistent help panel.

1. **Empty states that teach** — Rotation before groups exist explains halves of three; the timetable before a skeleton explains generating one. They vanish when content arrives, so a tutor on their fourth course never sees them.
2. **Blocked actions that say why** — "Lock the timetable before assigning rounds." This is the strongest teaching mechanism in the app; make it consistent everywhere an action is disabled.
3. **One-time notes** on genuinely new concepts (self-evaluation, starred action points carrying forward). Dismissed permanently, per person.

Guidance differs by role: admin needs sequencing (setup is done once), trainers need only blocked-action explanations (they repeat the loop), trainees need the most (first and only time, and anxious).

## 6. Chat channel rules by role

- **Trainer** — centre trainers, all staff, TP group channels, DMs to trainers on the same course. As built.
- **Trainee** — their own TP group, and DMs to their own tutors. **No cohort-wide channel.** Chat is informal; deadlines and feedback live in the workspace, and the picker says so.
- **Admin** — may not be on any course. Their pill lists course tutor groups they administer, not candidates.
- **Assessor / volunteer** — no chat at all.

Everything resets at local midnight. The bar states the reset and counts down to it.

---

## 7. Mobile scope

Website, not an app — a link is the product. Offer "Add to Home Screen" for trainees only (daily use for five weeks).

- **Trainer** — capture, not marking. Points typed or dictated during a TP, tagged and timestamped against the right candidate, appearing in the feedback form on the laptop.
- **Trainee** — everything, one question per screen, dictation on the question itself. Some candidates have no laptop; a course that assumes one excludes them.
- **Assessor** — reading.
- **Admin** — status plus the one or two decisions only they can make.
- **Laptop only** — marking against criteria, the rotation board, the grade meeting, editing the timetable, centre setup. Say so on the phone rather than shipping a cramped version.

## 8. Bugs found in the current build

1. `message-thread.tsx` uses `scrollIntoView` — can scroll the whole page. Set `el.scrollTop = el.scrollHeight` on the panel instead.
2. `StaffChatDrawer` is invisible until hovered — undiscoverable and unreachable by keyboard. Replace with the dimmed-at-rest pill.
3. Roster rows carry `cursor-pointer` but only the name cell is a link. Make the whole row navigate.
4. Course Stream uses emoji (🎥, 📎) where the rest of the app uses lucide. Swap for `Video` and `Paperclip`.
5. The "Pinned" badge is solid `bg-gold` — the only solid-gold fill in the app. Gold is reserved for the wordmark and Pass A. Use `.pill-gold`.
6. Broadcast titles are larger than the section heading above them. 20px/600.
7. Course Stream aligns its sidebar with an invisible spacer `<h2>Spacer</h2>`. Use a shared grid header row.
8. `TraineeEyebrowLabel` renders inside the wordmark `<Link>`, making the label part of the click target.

## 9. Still open — needs Ramy before building

1. Do carried TPs count toward the six assessed hours on a deferral's new course?
2. Which provisional grade **pairs** does the centre use ("PASS/PASS B")?
3. Does filmed observation count toward the six hours of observed experienced teaching, and does peer observation count at all?
4. What exactly does a **second marker** do — mark independently, or countersign?
5. How are **resubmission deadlines** set — fixed days after return, or from the timetable?
6. Do volunteers belong to a **class/level** or only to a course? (Designs assume class.)
7. Which centre documents does an assessor ask for, and how many portfolios do they scrutinise?
8. Does the CELTA 5 "original" mean the app's PDF or a scan of a signed document?
9. Cover sheet: print every section comment, or only the round it covers? One PDF per assignment or per round?

---

## 10. Design system

Tokens, radius, fonts and component classes are already correct in `globals.css` — keep them. Newsreader for headings and figures, Karla for everything else, Instrument Serif/Sans **only** in `Wordmark`. Teal primary, gold reserved (wordmark, Pass A, system-rule dots), cream ground, hairlines over fills, no box-shadows outside floating overlays.

Two patterns used throughout the designs and worth making shared components:

- **A 3px left rule** in place of a background fill, coloured by category. Used in the timetable, TP record, and every list where an item has a type.
- **A small gold dot** meaning "a system rule is in force" — the chat reset, a locked timetable, a released grade, an expiring link. One dot, one meaning, everywhere.
